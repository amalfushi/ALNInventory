# ALNInventory

### About
This is an unfinished inventory management and tracking program designed to help alleviate some isues managing that for a previous company.
It is integrated with Microsoft Excel using Apachi POI to allow for a more streamlined transition from manually tracking counts.
While it was built specifically for that company, I designed it to be a more universal program by allowing the user to set 
categories and items. The User Interface is created dynamically depending on what is located in the master excel sheet, so that
should allow it to be used for any small scale tracking. The program alerts users to items with a low stock based on the desired quantities.
Planned updates included some company-specific additions such as automated vendor-order generation, database support instead of being Excel
based, and a simple web app.
